I am a Computer Science PhD student at Northwestern University(NU) advised by Prof. [Annie Liang](https://www.anniehliang.com/) and Prof. [Ben Golub](https://bengolub.net/).

My research interest is the applications of Computer Science in Economics. I apply data science and machine learning techniques to problems in decision theory and network of economics. I am also interested in model building and evaluation.
