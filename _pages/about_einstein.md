I am a Computer Science PhD student at Northwestern University(NU) advised by Prof. [Annie Liang](https://www.anniehliang.com/) and Prof. [Ben Golub](https://bengolub.net/).

My research interest is the applications of Computer Science in Economics. I apply data science and machine learning techniques to problems in decision theory and network of economics. I am also interested in model building and evaluation.

I got my M.S. degree in CS from University of Chicago(UChicago), advised by Prof. Ian Foster and Prof. Kyle Chard. Before that, I got my B.S. degree in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).
